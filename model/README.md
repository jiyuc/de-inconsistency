The core implementation of GoDg & exGOA can be evaluated by running `bash combined_GNN_and_BERT/g_evaluation.sh`.
The test data as the format can be found in `data/test.txt`.

Within the folder: `/combined_GNN_and_BERT`, the flat concatenation of pre-trained GO hierarchical embedding and existing GOA node embedding can be found in the
`joint.py` and `graph_preprocessing.py`
